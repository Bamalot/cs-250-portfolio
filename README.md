# cs-250-portfolio
The final project for the CS250 Computer Science course, a course on the "Software Development Lifecycle."

When developing a program for a specific client, the client is the user of the program. It is important that user feedback and requested features are implemented into the software. Creating "user stories" during development helps with this because it gives structure to the user feedback. It can describe a new feature and how it should be implemented, or it could describe a bug and detail how the program isn't working properly.

When developing programs, I usually start with a main idea and some rough sketches before going into the projet. From this course I've been given several ideas that I will incorporate into my next project. The idea of "sprints" and dividing development into sections is great. That way I can make a plan before the sprint, stay on track of the main goal, and stay productive without being burned out. When the sprint is over I would reevaluate what needs to be developed next and keep going.

In order to be a good team member in software development, you must know a couple things. First, communication is essential. Not only should the team leader be communicating with you on what is expected of you, but you should also be communicating with your fellow team members and letting them know if development is going as planned or if any issues have shown up. Besides communication, humility is also important. Ego should not get in the way of collaborating with your team and taking constructive criticism from them.
